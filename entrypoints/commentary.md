since this project is available on several platforms,
there are multiples way to crates corresponding to different platforms:
- `desktop` for Windows (tested),  Linux and MacOS (both untested but should work fine)
- `android_app` for Android (tested)

Web and iOs are not supported yet, but should not be too hard to implement.
