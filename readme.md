# This is personal experimentation with Rust and android development.

## Desktop Build :
```cargo run --package desktop```
or 
```cargo run```


## Android Build :
```./gradlew assembleDebug```

warning: you need to have android SDK and NDK installed on your machine.  
You're likely to change the path to the SDK and NDK in the build.gradle file.
